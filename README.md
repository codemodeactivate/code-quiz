## Description

The content for this week were web APIs and we had a very brief introduction to JSON. I think this is a good opportunity to expand upon just the base acceptance criteria to really practice what we learned. Next week we'll be learning third party APIs. Probably doing a weather app, but I know we'll be using bootstrap & jQuery. I will attempt to use Bootstrap for this to familiarize myself.

Coding assessments are an important part of the interview process for developers. In fact, employers often use them to filter out job candidates with a cut-off score. To help you prepare, weâ€™ve developed a set of technical interview questions that you can answer throughout the course. The difficulty level of these questions will increase as you become a more proficient developer. If you take advantage of these opportunities to practice, you should be well-prepared to shine during the technical interview process toward the end of this course!
